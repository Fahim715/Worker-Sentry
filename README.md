# ü¶∫ Worker Sentry ‚Äì Real-Time PPE Compliance Detection

SafeVision AI is a real-time AI-powered safety monitoring system that detects PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) compliance such as helmets, gloves, and safety vests in workplace environments. Built on a fine-tuned YOLO model, the system processes CCTV or video footage and alerts when workers are not wearing required safety gear.
